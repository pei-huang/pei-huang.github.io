Research plays a key role in my teaching as students improve their analytical skills and economic thinking and master the tools of data analysis through hands-on exercises. Through the years, I have taught undergraduate and graduate courses on quantitative methodology, programming, and environmental economics.

While at ZEW, I co-taught the graduate course for *Quantitative Methods in Environmental and Energy Economics* with Prof. Dr. Sebastian Rausch at Heidelberg University in Germany for the summer semester of 2021, where my responsibility mainly involved teaching classes and mentoring studentsâ€™ group projects.

When I was a Ph.D. student at Texas A&M University, I also co-taught a graduate course *Applied Mathematical Programming* with Prof. Bruce McCarl for two semesters and served as a teaching assistant for two undergraduate courses in agribusiness and environmental and resource economics.
