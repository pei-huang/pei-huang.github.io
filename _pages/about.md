I am a Researcher at [ZEW](https://www.zew.de/en/) â€“ Leibniz Centre for European Economic Research in Mannheim, Germany. Before ZEW, I was a Postdoctoral Associate at [Yale School of the Environment](https://environment.yale.edu/).

I am passionate about finding policy solutions for a sustainable future using empirical and modeling approaches. My current research aims to address emerging topics in energy transitions, environmental justice, and climate change policy.

My research interests include:

- Environmental and energy economics
- Applied microeconomics
- Climate change economics
- Natural resource economics
